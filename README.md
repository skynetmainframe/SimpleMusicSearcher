# SimpleMusicSearcher

I gave Gemini by Google a request to make a Website called "Simple Music Searcher". It responded:

"That's a fantastic idea for a portfolio project\! "Simple Music Searcher" sounds like a great way to showcase a variety of programming skills. Let's break down your plan and get you started.

-----

## Project Structure and Technologies

You've made excellent choices with Angular for the frontend and Java Spring Boot for the backend. This is a common and highly sought-after full-stack combination. Docker will also be key for easy setup.

  * **`index.html`**: Yes, `index.html` is indeed the standard starting page for a web application. Your Angular application will be bootstrapped from this file.

-----

## Frontend (Angular)

Angular is perfect for building interactive user interfaces like your search bar.

### Layout Ideas

  * **Logo**: A simple `<img>` tag in your Angular component's template, styled with CSS, will handle this.
  * **Search Bar Structure**:
      * **"Choose Music Library"**: A `<select>` dropdown element would be ideal for this. You can populate its options dynamically from your backend (e.g., a list of supported APIs).
      * **Search Criteria Rows**: This is where Angular's component-based architecture shines.
          * You can create a custom Angular component (e.g., `SearchCriterionComponent`) that encapsulates a single row, containing:
              * A `<select>` for the search field (Artist, Song Name, etc.).
              * An `<input type="text">` for the search key.
              * A "magnifying glass" icon (you can use an icon library like Font Awesome or Material Icons) that, when clicked, triggers the search for that specific criterion.
          * On your main `AppComponent` or `SearchPageComponent`, you'll have a list or array of these `SearchCriterionComponent` instances.
          * **"Plus Sign"**: A button or icon (like a Font Awesome `fa-plus`) that, when clicked, adds a new `SearchCriterionComponent` to your list, allowing users to add more search rows dynamically.
          * You'll also need a main "Search" button that takes all the entered criteria and sends them to your backend.

### Key Angular Concepts to Use

  * **Components**: Break down your UI into reusable pieces.
  * **Services**: For fetching data from your backend API.
  * **Reactive Forms**: A powerful way to manage form input and validation, especially for dynamically added fields.
  * **Directives**: For manipulating the DOM (though less common for this specific task, good to know).
  * **HttpClientModule**: For making API requests to your Spring Boot backend.

-----

## Backend (Java Spring Boot)

Spring Boot will handle the logic for interacting with external music APIs and serving data to your Angular frontend.

### Core Functionality

  * **REST API Endpoints**: You'll expose REST endpoints that your Angular frontend will call.
      * `GET /api/music-libraries`: Returns a list of supported music APIs (Discogs, Spotify, Beatport, etc.).
      * `POST /api/search`: This will be your primary search endpoint. It will accept a JSON payload from Angular containing the chosen music library and an array of search criteria (e.g., `[{"field": "artist", "key": "Led Zeppelin"}, {"field": "genre", "key": "Rock"}]`).

### Integration with Music APIs

  * **API Clients**: For each music library you want to support (Discogs, Spotify, Beatport), you'll need to create a client (a Java class) that knows how to make requests to that specific API.
      * You'll likely use a library like **Spring WebClient** or **Retrofit** for making HTTP calls to these external APIs.
      * Remember to handle API keys and rate limits appropriately.

### Data Models

  * Define Java classes that represent your data (e.g., `MusicLibrary`, `SearchCriterion`, `SearchResult`).

### Key Spring Boot Concepts to Use

  * **REST Controllers**: To define your API endpoints.
  * **Services**: To encapsulate business logic (e.g., `MusicSearchService` that orchestrates calls to different API clients).
  * **Dependency Injection**: Spring's core feature for managing components and their dependencies.
  * **Spring Data JPA (Optional)**: If you wanted to cache search results or store user preferences, but for a showcase, direct API calls are fine.
  * **Configuration Properties**: To manage API keys and other external configurations.

-----

## Docker Setup

This is where you'll make it super easy for others to run your project.

### `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`

  * **Spring Boot `Dockerfile`**:
      * You'll create a `Dockerfile` in your Spring Boot project's root.
      * It will typically build your Java application (using Maven or Gradle) and then create a small image containing just the `JAR` file and a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Using multi-stage builds is highly recommended to keep the image size down.
  * **Angular `Dockerfile` (Optional but good practice)**:
      * You can also create a `Dockerfile` for your Angular frontend. This would build your Angular app and serve it using a lightweight web server like Nginx.
      * Alternatively, you can build your Angular app and place the static files directly into the Spring Boot `resources/static` directory, letting Spring Boot serve them. This simplifies the Docker setup to just one container. For a portfolio project, this might be the quicker route.
  * **`docker-compose.yml`**:
      * This file will orchestrate your containers.
      * It will define a **service** for your Spring Boot backend and potentially another **service** for your Angular frontend (if you choose to containerize it separately).
      * It will specify how these services should communicate (e.g., the Angular frontend calling the Spring Boot backend via a service name).

### Example `docker-compose.yml` (Simplified)

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend # Path to your Spring Boot project root
    ports:
      - "8080:8080" # Map host port 8080 to container port 8080
    environment:
      # Example: pass API keys as environment variables
      DISCOGS_API_KEY: your_discogs_key
      SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID: your_spotify_client_id
      SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET: your_spotify_client_secret
    # volumes:
    #   - ./backend:/app # Mount the backend code for development
  frontend: # If you decide to containerize Angular separately
    build: ./frontend # Path to your Angular project root
    ports:
      - "4200:80" # Map host port 4200 to container port 80 (Nginx default)
    depends_on:
      - backend # Ensure backend starts before frontend
```

-----

## GitHub Repository

  * **Clear `README.md`**: This is crucial for a portfolio project. Include:
      * A clear project description ("Simple Music Searcher - A full-stack web application showcasing music API integration with Angular and Spring Boot.").
      * Screenshots of your application.
      * **Setup Instructions**: Detailed steps on how to clone the repo, run `docker compose up`, and access the website.
      * Technologies Used.
      * Future Improvements (ideas you have but didn't implement).
      * Your contact information.
  * **Organized Folders**:
      * `frontend/` (for your Angular project)
      * `backend/` (for your Spring Boot project)
      * `docker-compose.yml` (in the root, or within a `deploy/` folder)

-----

This project will demonstrate your ability to:

  * Design and implement a user interface with Angular.
  * Build a robust backend API with Spring Boot.
  * Integrate with external APIs.
  * Containerize applications using Docker.
  * Manage a full-stack project.

Good luck with your "Simple Music Searcher"\! It sounds like a fantastic way to impress potential employers or collaborators. Do you want to start by setting up the basic Angular and Spring Boot projects, or dive straight into the Docker configuration?"

I also asked Gemini if I can use the SDKs on AWS for coding and not use AWS's cloud services. Here is the response:

This is an excellent clarification! You're completely right that using AWS SDKs locally for development purposes, without deploying your application to AWS cloud services, incurs zero cost directly from AWS.

Here's why:

    SDKs are Libraries: The AWS SDKs (for Java, JavaScript/Angular, etc.) are simply software libraries that you include in your project. They contain code that makes it easier to interact with AWS services, but they don't run on AWS themselves. They run on your local machine (or in your Docker containers, which will also be running locally).

    No Service Consumption: When you use an SDK to make an API call, you're usually interacting with an AWS service (like S3 for storage, Lambda for serverless functions, EC2 for virtual servers, etc.). If you're not actually making calls to these live AWS services, you're not consuming any AWS resources, and therefore, you're not being charged.

    "Cloud Services" vs. "SDKs": The cost comes from the cloud services themselves (e.g., storing data in S3, running a Lambda function, running an EC2 instance, transferring data in and out of AWS). You've explicitly stated you don't want to use their cloud services, which means you won't incur those charges.

Your situation on a shared PC:

Since you can't do anything locally on the machine, your plan to use Docker is even more crucial. You'll be using Docker to create isolated environments where your Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend can run. These Docker containers will be running on your shared PC, not on AWS.

What you might incur costs for (unrelated to AWS SDKs directly):

    Internet Usage: If your shared PC has metered internet usage, downloading the SDKs, dependencies (Maven for Java, npm for Angular), and Docker images will consume data. This is typically a negligible cost for most internet plans.

    External Music APIs: This is the most significant potential cost. When your Spring Boot backend makes calls to Discogs, Spotify, Beatport, etc., you'll be subject to their API usage policies and any associated costs.

        Free Tiers: Many music APIs offer free tiers for basic usage, which might be sufficient for a portfolio project.

        Rate Limits: Be mindful of rate limits on these APIs to avoid getting blocked or incurring unexpected charges if you exceed free tiers.

        Developer Accounts: You'll likely need developer accounts with each of these services.

In summary:

You can code your "Simple Music Searcher" using AWS SDKs for development on your shared PC (via Docker) with zero direct cost from AWS. Your only potential costs related to the application itself would be for exceeding free tiers or rate limits on the external music APIs you integrate with.

This is a very cost-effective approach for showcasing your skills!

You're asking about a very common and effective strategy for managing cloud costs during development: using AWS resources only when needed and shutting them down when you're done. This "pay-as-you-go" model is one of the biggest advantages of cloud computing.

Let's break down the costs and how to manage them for your scenario:

## Core AWS Services for Your Project

For a basic development and testing environment, you'd primarily use:

1.  **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** This is where your Spring Boot backend (and potentially your Angular frontend if you don't serve it statically from S3) would run. You'd launch a virtual server (an "instance") here.
2.  **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** You mentioned "storage on AWS." S3 is object storage, ideal for storing static files (like your compiled Angular frontend, images, or other assets). If you need a relational database for your backend, you'd use Amazon RDS.
3.  **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):** If your Spring Boot application requires a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), RDS provides managed database instances. This saves you the effort of setting up and maintaining a database server on an EC2 instance.
4.  **Data Transfer Out:** Data leaving AWS (e.g., your Angular frontend served to your browser, or API responses from your backend). Data transfer *into* AWS is generally free.

## AWS Free Tier: Your Best Friend

AWS offers a generous **Free Tier** for new accounts, which is absolutely critical for keeping development costs low. For the first 12 months after signing up, you get:

* **EC2:** 750 hours per month of `t2.micro` or `t3.micro` instances (Linux or Windows). This is enough to run one instance constantly for the entire month.
* **S3:** 5 GB of Standard Storage, 20,000 GET requests, and 2,000 PUT requests.
* **RDS:** 750 hours per month of `db.t2.micro` or `db.t3.micro` instances.

**This Free Tier can significantly cover your development and testing needs for a year, assuming moderate usage.**

## Cost Breakdown When Not in Free Tier (or Exceeding It)

If you exceed the Free Tier or after your 12 months are up, here's how costs generally accumulate:

### 1. Amazon EC2 (Compute)

* **Pricing Model:** EC2 instances are billed by the hour or by the second (with a minimum of 60 seconds) for On-Demand instances.
* **Cost Drivers:**
    * **Instance Type:** `t` series (like `t3.micro`) are "burstable" instances, good for general development as they're cost-effective. Larger instances (e.g., `m` series, `c` series) cost more.
    * **Operating System:** Linux is generally cheaper than Windows.
    * **Region:** Prices can vary slightly by AWS Region (e.g., Frankfurt, Ireland, N. Virginia).
    * **Running Time:** This is the most crucial factor for you.

* **Example (Europe - Frankfurt region, `t3.micro` Linux):**
    * A `t3.micro` instance typically costs around **$0.0104 per hour**.
    * If you run it for **4 hours a day, 5 days a week** (assuming 20 hours/week), that's `20 hours * $0.0104/hour * 4 weeks = ~$0.832 per month`.
    * If you forget to shut it down and it runs constantly, it's `24 hours * 30 days * $0.0104/hour = ~$7.49 per month`.

### 2. Amazon S3 (Storage)

* **Pricing Model:** Billed per GB per month for storage, plus charges for requests (PUT, GET, LIST) and data transfer out.
* **Cost Drivers:**
    * **Storage Class:** S3 Standard is good for frequently accessed data. If you have backup files you rarely touch, other classes (like S3 Infrequent Access or Glacier) are cheaper but have retrieval costs/times.
    * **Amount of Data:** How many GBs you store.
    * **Number of Requests:** How many times your application or users read/write files.
    * **Data Transfer Out:** Data leaving S3 to the internet.

* **Example (Europe - Frankfurt region, S3 Standard):**
    * Storage: `$0.024 per GB per month` for the first 50 TB. For a few GBs of static website files, this is negligible (e.g., 1 GB = $0.024/month).
    * Requests: PUT/COPY/POST/LIST: `$0.005 per 1,000 requests`. GET/SELECT: `$0.0004 per 1,000 requests`.
    * Data Transfer Out: Free for the first 100GB monthly (aggregated across all services). After that, around `$0.09 per GB`.

### 3. Amazon RDS (Database)

* **Pricing Model:** Billed by the hour for the database instance, plus storage, I/O, and data transfer.
* **Cost Drivers:**
    * **Database Instance Type:** Again, `db.t3.micro` is the most cost-effective for development.
    * **Database Engine:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. (prices are usually similar for micro instances).
    * **Storage Type and Size:** General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3) is common.
    * **Running Time:** Crucial for cost control.

* **Example (Europe - Frankfurt region, `db.t3.micro` MySQL):**
    * Instance: Around `$0.017 per hour`.
    * Storage: Around `$0.115 per GB per month` for General Purpose SSD.
    * If you run it for **4 hours a day, 5 days a week** (20 hours/week), that's `20 hours * $0.017/hour * 4 weeks = ~$1.36 per month`, plus a small amount for storage.
    * If you forget to shut it down and it runs constantly, it's `24 hours * 30 days * $0.017/hour = ~$12.24 per month`, plus storage.

### Other Potential Costs (Minor for your case)

* **Elastic IP Addresses:** If you allocate a public IP address to your EC2 instance but it's *not* associated with a running instance, you're charged a very small amount (e.g., $0.005 per hour). This is why it's best to release EIPs when terminating instances or ensure they are properly associated.
* **EBS Volumes:** The persistent storage attached to your EC2 instance. Even when the EC2 instance is stopped, if the EBS volume persists, you'll be charged for the storage used (e.g., $0.05 per GB per month). **Crucially, make sure you delete EBS volumes associated with terminated instances if you don't need them.**
* **API Gateway/Load Balancers:** Not strictly necessary for a simple dev setup, but if you used them, they have their own costs.

## Can You Shut Off All AWS Resources? **YES, ABSOLUTELY!**

This is the key to cost control. AWS operates on a "pay-as-you-go" model, so if you stop using resources, you stop paying for them (with the exception of persistent storage like EBS volumes that you don't delete, and some services with minimum commitments like certain Reserved Instances or Savings Plans, which you won't be using for simple dev/test).

**How to shut down (or stop) resources:**

* **EC2 Instances:** You can `Stop` an EC2 instance. When stopped, you stop paying for compute time, but you still pay for the attached EBS storage. To stop paying for EBS storage, you need to `Terminate` the instance and *ensure its associated EBS volume is deleted* (there's usually a checkbox for this when terminating). For development, `Stop` is often convenient if you plan to resume work the next day, as it preserves the instance's configuration. Just remember to terminate it when you're truly done with the project.
* **RDS Instances:** You can `Stop` an RDS instance for up to 7 days. After 7 days, it automatically starts again. This is great for short breaks. For longer breaks or when completely done, you need to `Delete` the RDS instance. Make sure to take a final snapshot if you want to restore it later.
* **S3 Buckets:** You don't "shut off" S3. You simply stop adding/accessing data. To completely stop costs, you'd need to delete the bucket and all its contents.

**Best Practices for Cost Management During Development:**

1.  **Leverage the Free Tier:** Maximize your usage of free tier services for the first 12 months.
2.  **Use `t` series instances:** For EC2 and RDS, these are designed for burstable workloads and are the most cost-effective for dev/test.
3.  **Stop Instances When Not Working:** **This is the single biggest cost-saving measure.** Develop a habit of stopping your EC2 and RDS instances when you're finished for the day. You can even automate this with AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events.
4.  **Delete Unused Resources:** Regularly review your AWS account and delete any EC2 instances, EBS volumes, RDS databases, S3 buckets, or other resources you no longer need. Unattached EBS volumes are a common "silent killer" of budgets.
5.  **Set Up Billing Alerts:** Configure AWS Billing Alarms in CloudWatch to notify you if your estimated monthly bill exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., $5, $10). This catches unexpected charges early.
6.  **Use AWS Cost Explorer:** Regularly check Cost Explorer in the AWS Management Console to understand where your money is going.

**Approximate Cost for Your Scenario (after Free Tier):**

If you are diligent about stopping resources, your costs will be very low, likely **less than €5-€15 per month**, even without the Free Tier, assuming:

* You use small EC2 (`t3.micro`) and RDS (`db.t3.micro`) instances.
* You only run them for a few hours a day, a few days a week.
* Your S3 storage is minimal (a few GBs).
* You keep data transfer out to a minimum during development.
* You are careful to delete unneeded resources (especially EBS volumes).

If you accidentally leave instances running 24/7 after the Free Tier, that amount could jump to €20-€30 easily, depending on instance sizes.

**Crucial Point for a Shared PC:**
Since you can't install things locally, AWS Cloud9 might be an alternative worth considering for your development environment. Cloud9 is an AWS-managed IDE that runs on an EC2 instance. It *does* incur EC2 costs (which can be covered by the Free Tier), but it means you don't need to install anything on the shared PC except a web browser. You could access your development environment entirely through the browser. This aligns well with your "no local installs" constraint.
